## Minimalist React App
This app includes a v2 tag, which does not include JSX.

All three JavaScript files are just the raw code for the various dependencies 
that my React app needs to run; something like 35,000 lines of JS code.

The reason I did this this way is to show my students how much JS work we 
are blessed to not have to do ourselves, and to see how simple the actual 
React application that we write actually is, comparatively.
